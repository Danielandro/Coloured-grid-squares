# Coloured-grid-squares (Etch-A-Sketch)
Create a sketch grid using vanilla JavaScript

This is one of the JavaScript/jQuery projects from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery)

You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.<br>
The key is to break it down into little manageable steps and then figure out how to solve each step in turn.

## Assignment


* **Create a web page (or use JSFiddle) with a 16x16 grid of square divs.** 
* **Create your divs using Javascript/jQuery… don’t try making them by hand with copy-pasting!**
* **Set up a hover effect so it changes the color of the square when your mouse passes over it, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.**
* **Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered, the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) and now you’ve got a new sketch pad.**
